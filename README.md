Implement services (Rabbitmq, Activemq,...) on docker, and create simple queue(pub,sub) using python.

In this repo 4 famous message brokers (kafka which is used more in data streaming) are implemented and integrated with simple python code. Before doing any thing let's discuss what are queues and these services.

## Rabbitmq

RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol, MQ Telemetry Transport, and other protocols.

- [X] Rabbitmq is used as a single node and in cluster mode.
- [X] Auto ack is enabled.
- [X] AMQP is used.
